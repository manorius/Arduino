 Chat  Server

 A simple server that distributes any incoming messages to all
 connected clients.  To use telnet to  your device's IP address and type.
 You can see the client's input in the serial monitor as well.

 This example is written for a network using WPA encryption. For
 WEP or WPA, change the Wifi.begin() call accordingly.


 Circuit:
 * Origin for CC3200 LaunchPad or 
   F5529/TivaC LaunchPad with CC3000/CC3100 BoosterPack
 * Modified for DUO Board

/*
 * SYSTEM_MODE:
 *     - AUTOMATIC: Automatically try to connect to Wi-Fi and the Particle Cloud and handle the cloud messages.
 *     - SEMI_AUTOMATIC: Manually connect to Wi-Fi and the Particle Cloud, but automatically handle the cloud messages.
 *     - MANUAL: Manually connect to Wi-Fi and the Particle Cloud and handle the cloud messages.
 *     
 * SYSTEM_MODE(AUTOMATIC) does not need to be called, because it is the default state. 
 * However the user can invoke this method to make the mode explicit.
