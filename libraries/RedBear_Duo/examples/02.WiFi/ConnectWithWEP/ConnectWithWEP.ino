/*

 This example connects to a WEP-encrypted Wifi network.
 Then it prints the MAC address of the Wifi Duo
 the IP address obtained, and other network details.

 If you use 40-bit WEP, you need a key that is 10 characters long,
 and the characters must be hexadecimal (0-9 or A-F).
 e.g.  for 40-bit, ABBADEAF01 will work, but ABBADEAF won't work
 (too short) and ABBAISDEAF won't work (I and S are not
 hexadecimal characters).

 For 128-bit, you need a string that is 26 characters long.
 D0D0DEADF00DABBADEAFBEADED will work because it's 26 characters,
 all in the 0-9, A-F range.

  Circuit:
 * Origin for CC3200 WiFi LaunchPad or CC3100 WiFi BoosterPack
   with TM4C or MSP430 LaunchPad
 * Modified for DUO Board
