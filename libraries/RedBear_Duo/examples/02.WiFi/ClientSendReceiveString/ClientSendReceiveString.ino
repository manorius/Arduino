/*

 This example demonstrates using the cc3200 as a wifi client (TCP)
 The client will connect to the TCP server.
 
 Write something in the serial console to send it to the server.
 Anything the server sends back will be printed in the serial console

 * SYSTEM_MODE:
 *     - AUTOMATIC: Automatically try to connect to Wi-Fi and the Particle Cloud and handle the cloud messages.
 *     - SEMI_AUTOMATIC: Manually connect to Wi-Fi and the Particle Cloud, but automatically handle the cloud messages.
 *     - MANUAL: Manually connect to Wi-Fi and the Particle Cloud and handle the cloud messages.
 *     
 * SYSTEM_MODE(AUTOMATIC) does not need to be called, because it is the default state. 
 * However the user can invoke this method to make the mode explicit.
